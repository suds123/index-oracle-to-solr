# Install Elasticsearch

We used pre-packaged "Elasticsearch Certified by Bitnami" VM on Google Compute Engine.

## Why use Bitnami Certified images?

Bitnami certifies that their images are secure, up-to-date, and packaged using industry best practices.
Bitnami monitors all components and libraries for vulnerabilities, outdated components, and application updates. When one is reported, they update and release every affected listing within a couple days at most.
